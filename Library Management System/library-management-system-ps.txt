Problem Statement : Library Management System

You need to design a schema diagram with the following requirements:

The system has Users â†’ two types: Librarian and Member (inheritance).

A Member can borrow multiple Books, but each Book can be borrowed by only one Member at a time (one-to-many).

Each Book belongs to one Category, but a Category can have many Books (many-to-one).

Every Member has one Library Card (one-to-one).
