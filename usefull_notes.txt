1 ↔ 1 → foreign key in the dependent/optional table + UNIQUE constraint.

1 → M / M → 1 → only a foreign key in the "many" side.

M ↔ M → must introduce a junction (third) table; introducing third table breaks this relation into 1 → M & M → 1.

One-to-One FK placement → put the foreign key in the dependent/optional table (the one that extends or relies on the other).

One-to-One vs One-to-Many → both use a foreign key, but One-to-One adds a UNIQUE constraint on the FK.
